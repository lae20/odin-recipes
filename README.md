project-recipes
This the first project i am doiong with the The Odin Prject. Using the HTML I
am going to make a web page about cooking. This project will contain some
recipes that I have learned since I was moved in South Korea. I am still a beginner
but I will try my very best to do it as much as I could. I have a little knowledge
in HTML and CSS.
