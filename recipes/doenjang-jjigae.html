            <li>100g / 3.5 ounces enoki mushrooms, stems removed & separated</li>
            <li>45g / 1.5 ounces shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>250g / 8.8 ounces tofu, sliced into medium rectangle pieces</li>

            <li>(optional) 2-3 chilies (green and red), thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the beef with rice wine and black peppers in a bowl. Mix them well. Preheat a medium sized pot briefly over medium high heat. Add the meat and stir. (You won't need to add any oil as the meat should have some fat attached to it.) Cook until it browns. Add the potatoes and stir for about 2 mins.
                Stir frying beef and potatoes in a heavy pot</li>
            <li> Pour over the rice water and start boiling. Add doenjang (Korean soybean paste) and ssamjang (Korean spicy dipping sauce) into the water, using a sieve, so it is easier to dissolve. Add gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) and garlic. Stir around.</li>
            <li>Once the water starts rolling boiling, add the zucchini and onions. Boil for 1 min. Add the mushrooms and tofu then boil for 1 min. Add green onions and chilies and boil a further 1 min. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li> Serve with steamed rice and other Korean side dishes. (i.e. the side dish below shows - Korean egg roll, seasoned seaweed, radish kimchi)</li>
